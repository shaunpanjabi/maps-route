# maps-route
Collect data from Bing Maps API

    Class is used to build proper URL for Bing Maps API and collect traffic data for a route.
    The idea is to get poll Bing Maps for a route and get the total duration in traffic. These
    data points are stored in pickle, and can be reopened later and examined visually.

    See Bing Routes API for more info on what parameters to use.
